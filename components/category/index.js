    "7.Protecting Routes and Resources:With JWT authentication, you can protect routes and resources in your API by requiring a valid JWT token for access. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or performing privileged operations.",
    "8.Role-Based Access Control:JWT tokens can contain information about the user's role or permissions, allowing you to implement role-based access control in your API. This ensures that only users with the necessary privileges can access certain resources or perform specific actions.",
    "9.Securing Communication with HTTPS:In addition to JWT authentication, it's essential to secure communication between clients and servers using HTTPS (HTTP Secure). This encrypts data transmitted over the network, preventing it from being intercepted or tampered with by malicious actors.",
    "10.Handling Token Revocation:In some cases, you may need to revoke a JWT token before it expires, such as when a user logs out or changes their password. To handle token revocation, you can maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens on the server and check incoming tokens against this blacklist during authentication.",
    "11.Best Practices for JWT Security:When implementing JWT authentication, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure the security of your API. This includes keeping secret keys secure, validating tokens carefully, and using HTTPS to protect data in transit. Additionally, you should consider using libraries or frameworks that handle JWT authentication securely and efficiently.",
